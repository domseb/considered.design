    <h1>My journey in design</h1>
  </div>
  <article class="post-content left">
    <p>My name is Dominic, and Iâ€™m currently Head of Design for <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="https://www.qwilr.com/">qwilr</a></span> in Sydney. Leading design on our product, brand and marketing, over the past few years I've committed to building a solid design process within the company. Before Smart Sparrow, I was working on freelance UX projects in Rio and London, and before that I was Head of Design for Augmented Reality specialists <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="https://twitter.com/digicave">digicave</a></span> in Brighton (RIP).</p>
    <p>Although originally trained in Industrial Design at <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/Industrial-Design-and-Technology-BA">brunel</a></span>, I came to a turning point in my final year project redesigning a neonatal ventilator for <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="http://www.sle.co.uk/products/life-support/ventilators/sle5000">sle</a></span>. Sleeker mouldings and manufacturing efficiencies couldn't help me with the biggest issues with use â€“ and the part I wasn't allowed to design â€“ the UI. Whilst Industrial Design had heritage and substance, designing for the screen had agility and speed, and I've been designing for it ever since.</p>
    <p>Outside of design, writing and film are my main passions, and are something Iâ€™m going to be working on more this year. If you have an interesting project and want to collaborate, <a class="line" href="mailto:dominic@considered.design?Subject=ðŸ‘‹">email me</a> or reach out on <a class="line" href="https://twitter.com/dominosebastian">Twitter</a> - I'd love to hear from you.</p>

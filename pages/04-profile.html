    <p>My name is Dominic, and Iâ€™m currently Design Lead for <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="https://www.qwilr.com/">qwilr</a></span>, based in Sydney. Over the past year I've been redesigning their core offering, extending value to their growing customer base, and maturing design and its systems across the product and engineering team. Before Qwilr, I was Head of Design for <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="https://www.qwilr.com/">smart sparrow</a></span>, managing design on their quite of products, their brand and marketing, creating the next generation of online learning tools for educators.
    </p>
    <p>Although originally trained in Industrial Design at <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/Industrial-Design-and-Technology-BA">brunel</a></span>, I came to a turning point in my final year project redesigning a neonatal ventilator for <span class="scaps"><a class="line" href="http://www.sle.co.uk/products/life-support/ventilators/sle5000">sle</a></span>. Sleeker mouldings and manufacturing efficiencies couldn't help me with the biggest issues with use â€“ and the part I wasn't allowed to design â€“ the UI. Whilst Industrial Design had heritage and substance, designing for the screen had agility and speed, and I've been designing for it ever since.</p>
    <p>Outside of design, writing and film are my main passions, and are something Iâ€™m going to be working on more this year. If you have an interesting project and want to collaborate, <a class="line" href="mailto:dominic@considered.design?Subject=ðŸ‘‹">email me</a> or reach out on <a class="line" href="https://twitter.com/dominosebastian">Twitter</a> - I'd love to hear from you.</p>

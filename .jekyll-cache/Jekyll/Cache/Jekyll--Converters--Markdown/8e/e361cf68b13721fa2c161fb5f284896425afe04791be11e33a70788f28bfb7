            <p class="description">Qwilr‚Äôs headcount had grown, and with it brought more stakeholders, users and exciting use cases for the brand. To make this rebrand a success (both internally &amp; externally) I wanted to involve departments early in the process, so we could understand what we all needed, and create shared goals to align our efforts around.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">Challenge</h4>

<h3 id="a-sprawling-patchwork">A sprawling patchwork</h3>

<p>The existing brand was suffering from a lack of direction, both visually and strategically. Each area had it‚Äôs own style, without the grounding of a broader narrative. In an effort to get work out quickly, the dreaded amorphous blob had been deployed, as well as stock images, colours without intentionality, and outdated product shots and styles. Worst of all, there was no distinction between our brand and the customer‚Äôs brand. Making it hard for customers to visualise their own success in the product.</p>

<h4 id="strategy">Strategy</h4>

<h3 id="co-design-workshops">Co-design workshops</h3>

<p>Three key themes emerged early on in discussions. How could the brand be easier to use? How could it have a clearer point of view in the market? How can the brand be more empowering than policing? To co-design the outcome to these questions, I brought in key perspectives through a series of workshops. Helping create a shared understanding of what we all wanted, and really needed, to focus on with our limited resources.</p>

<h3 id="foundations">Foundations</h3>

<p>The logo needed to embody the new brand personality, work as a standalone logo, but not detract too much when in the presence of individual products. Every letter leans up and to the right, signalling progress and momentum. The profile of the A is also mirrored by the M, to create a sense of symmetry and rhythm.</p>

<h3 id="brand-system">Brand System</h3>

<p>The brand had to work across a lot of diverse touchpoints, both on their own properties, Shopify app store and review sites. Wanted something dynamic, easy to remix, and still embody the brand personality and strategy.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>

<p>We focussed most of our efforts on the two biggest bottlenecks in getting Marketing work live; fleshing out the layout of pages, and creating assets to support them. Aiming to improving speed while minimising the tradeoff on quality, I create a series of templates, components and ready to use assets for the teams in the Brand Book. To make it easier to explore new ideas quickly, and enable teams to launch new brand assets without endless cycles of sign offs. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketing site components to build landing pages faster</li>
  <li>Figma wireframe kit that matched the above</li>
  <li>Figma components for teams to create their own avatars</li>
  <li>A new shared library on Kaleidoscope for ready to use assets</li>
</ul>

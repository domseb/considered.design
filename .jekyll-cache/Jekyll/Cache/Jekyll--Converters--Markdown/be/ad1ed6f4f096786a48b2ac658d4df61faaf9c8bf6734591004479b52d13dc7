<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>

<p>While the individual products in the Amp portfolio are in highly competitive areas, there were much fewer competitors for Amp itself. Competitors on the whole were hard to differentiate between in a sea of blue gradients. My initial workshop and discovery looked for an opportunity to be more expressive, to cut through the noise, and differentiate . To position it as something energising, direct and empowering.</p>

<p>The products in the Amp portfolio are in highly competitive areas individually, but there were much fewer competitors for Amp itself. Eyeing cross sell and bundling opportuniteis, Amp wanted to have more presence on the individual product level. Competitors on the whole were hard to differentiate between, mainly being modern but reserved. There was an opportunity to be more expressive to cut through the noise. To position it as something energising, direct and empowering.</p>

I’ve been designing various digital services for the past few years, and my strengths are being able to distill a client’s intentions, and make them visually digestible to users. Making time at the start of a project to define these intentions helps shift focus to meeting user’s needs, so we can deliver something with actual benefits, not just fad features.

Having a robust creative process enables me to define strong design intentions, which act as pillars for each step of the project to defer back to – from wireframes to final delivery.

If you have an interesting project you need help with, or are keen to collaborate, please get in touch via any of my networks below. I’d love to hear from you.

			<h3>Ending your relationship with Smart Sparrow</h3>
			<p>The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Smart Sparrow as set out below. If you want to terminate your legal agreement with Smart Sparrow, you may do so by (a) notifying Smart Sparrow at any time and (b) closing your accounts for all of the Services which you use, where Smart Sparrow has made this option available to you. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to Smart Sparrow’s address which is set out at the beginning of these Terms. Smart Sparrow may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or</li>
				<li>Smart Sparrow is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or</li>
				<li>the partner with whom Smart Sparrow offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with Smart Sparrow or ceased to offer the Services to you; or</li>
				<li>Smart Sparrow is transitioning to no longer providing the Services to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service; or</li>
				<li>the provision of the Services to you by Smart Sparrow is, in Smart Sparrow’s opinion, no longer commercially viable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Smart Sparrow have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation.</p>

			<h3>Exclusion of warranties</h3>

			<p>Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the services is done at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or other device or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Smart Sparrow or through or from the services shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the terms. Smart Sparrow further expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>
			<h3>Limitation of liability</h3>

This shall include, but not be limited to, any loss of profit (whether incurred directly or indirectly), any loss of goodwill or business reputation, any loss of data suffered, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or other intangible loss;</li>
				<li>Any loss or damage which may be incurred by you, including but not limited to loss or damage as a result of:</li>

			<ul>
				<li>any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, or as a result of any relationship or transaction between you and any advertiser or sponsor whose advertising appears on the services;</li>
				<li>any changes which Smart Sparrow may make to the services, or for any permanent or temporary cessation in the provision of the services (or any features within the services);</li>

				<li>your failure to provide Smart Sparrow with accurate account information;</li>

			</ul>
			<p>The limitations on Smart Sparrow’s liability to you in paragraph 1 above shall apply whether or not Smart Sparrow has been advised of or should have been aware of the possibility of any such losses arising.</p>

			<h3>Other content</h3>
			<p>The Services may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content or resources. Smart Sparrow may have no control over any web sites or resources which are provided by companies or persons other than Smart Sparrow. You acknowledge and agree that Smart Sparrow is not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from such web sites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that Smart Sparrow is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such web sites or resources.</p>

			<h3>Changes to the Terms</h3>
			<p>Smart Sparrow may make changes to the Terms from time to time, and will make a new copy of the Terms available at <a href="/terms">smartsparrow.com/terms</a>, and any new additional terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the relevant Services. You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Terms have changed, Smart Sparrow will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

			<h3>General legal terms</h3>
			<p>Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals. The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Smart Sparrow and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Smart Sparrow may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Smart Sparrow in relation to the Services. You agree that Smart Sparrow may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services. You agree that if Smart Sparrow does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Smart Sparrow has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Smart Sparrow’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Smart Sparrow. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable. You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Smart Sparrow is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms. The Terms, and your relationship with Smart Sparrow under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Smart Sparrow agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within New South Wales, Australia, to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Smart Sparrow shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>

			<p>Smart Sparrow is an Australian ed-tech start-up pioneering adaptive and personalized learning technology. It was founded by Dr Dror Ben Naim who led a research group in the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Educational Data Mining at the University of New South Wales in Sydney resulting in the development of the Adaptive eLearning Platform.</p>

			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>Back in 2005, Dror was building a bunch of Virtual Labs for the School of Physics and thought it might be a cool idea to do a PhD on how to make them adaptive. A year into his research and many sleepless nights later, he invented the Adaptive eLearning Platform and asked Zack to join his newly formed Research Group. Shao soon joined the AeRG to complete his honors thesis as he wanted to reinvent the way traditional tutorials were taught in Engineering, and Adaptive eLearning was the key to do so. The Adaptive eLearning Research Group was born (we agree the name could have been a bit more catchy).</p>
			<p>We worked at UNSW for 4 years and what can we say – the teachers loved us. They even brought their friends along. We were, and still are, chuffed. When we had hundreds of teachers and tens of thousands of students we knew we were onto something, but Dror also knew he had to finish that PhD.</p>
			<p>In 2011, we formed Smart Sparrow and started looking for investment. Luckily, we met Michelle from One-Ventures who believed in us. We were, and still are, thankful.</p>
			<p>The Sparrow, in Hebrew, is the bird of freedom and we really think that education emancipates the mind. We know that learning is way better when it is adaptive, and that there is so much more that software can do for teaching than all those Multiple Choice quizzes – it’s not even funny.</p>
			<p>We’re here to show that technology is not the sole domain of Games and Movies – let’s build amazing and smart content together.</p>

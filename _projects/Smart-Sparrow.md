When I was hired by Smart Sparrow as their Senior UX Designer, my intended focus was to help reduce the steep learning curve of the product, and to create an onboarding process that could expedite the journey for new users to become power users.

### About Smart Sparrow
Smart Sparrow is a learning design platform that enables anyone to create rich, interactive and adaptive elearning courseware.
After [raising $10m in 2014](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/smart-sparrow-lands-in-the-us-and-raises-10-million-1888384.htm) and expanding to San Francisco, they’ve worked with over 500 institutions globally, and won numerous awards. Their latest project is next-generation science courseware, funded by a [grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.afr.com/news/policy/education/bill-gates-backs-aussie-startup-smart-sparrow-20141005-jludb), to help educate 250,000 community college across the United States.

### Rebuilding the relationship
When I started this was a 24 step tool tip marathon around the product, which although descriptive, wasn’t educating the users on anything but the shallowest understanding of the tool. It was replaced with our first attempt at a new onboarding tour, which ended up becomming a long click through, outlining all the concepts, without any real enjoyment for the user.

Inspired by [Primer](https://www.yourprimer.com/), we wanted to break it down into a series of micro lessons, that we can spread across the areas of the product, to make the information you were being given, contextual to which part of the product you were in.

### Getting the users to invest in the story
The onboarding tour we had created had the right points to say but the wrong way of saying them. The promise of the product boils down to software that can recreate all the benefits of one to one learning, online at scale. This is an exciting promise for educators, and we wanted to get the users invested in that story as soon as possible. More importantly it went against our values of what makes the best learning experiences - visually rich, interactive, and personalised. Before we had dealt with it in abstract terms, but now we’d changed it to ask the user questions, and it would use their answers to demonstrate how the product worked.

### Creating smooth handovers & maintaining presence
After trialling automated onboarding emails, we realised the issue wasn’t in just getting users back into the product – there was no continuation from those emails to when they landed in the product to tell them what to do next. We’re now using a service that allows us send the same automated emails, and then greet them with personalised messaged once they log back in, in different areas of the product, and most importantly, at different stages of the process the users is at.


### Next steps
I’ve always treated onboarding as a deliverable on a checklist, but after working on a product for an extended period of time, it’s clear to say it’s a very involved, very important process for success, and it’s never something that’s finished.

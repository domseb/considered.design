The Smart Sparrow website needed a major overhaul, to update all our recent branding work, and to make the site mobile response. My role as Lead Product Designer was to review our analytics, marketing and design goals for the site, and deliver the site through rapid iteration over 3 weeks from wireframe to final commit. Since launching , time on site is up, and weâ€™ve increased conversion rate by 5%.

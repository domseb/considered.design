Smart Sparrow is a product for Learning Designers to create online courseware. Allowing anyone to create personalised lessons that can adapt to individual student needs. I joined after their Series B to give a dedicated focus on the user experience across their products. For the past 2 years I’ve been the design lead across all product, brand and marketing efforts.

### Student Focussed Workspace
Smart Sparrow has two main products . One to create personalised courseware, called the Author. The other to manage the courseware and distribute it to students, called the Workspace.

The original Workspace was centered around individual lessons, with each lesson having many actions. The problem was there was no way of carrying these actions across lessons. Teaching two lessons to the same students? Had to enroll in one, then repeat enrollment for the other. This was becoming a mess, and creating serious issues with understanding of license quotas. Worst of all though, it made tracking student understanding across lessons almost impossible.

We spoke to users, gathered requirements, brainstormed, prototyped and tested. After months we had a design that could centralise all the lesson’s actions in one place. We called it Classes. This gave users complete control of their students and content they are teaching them. Classes represented a significant change in the focus of the Workspace. We had changed it from being lesson focussed, to student focussed. A theme we would continue to thread throughout the product and brand.

### Unifying the visual style
Adding Classes was a significant change to how users interacted with the Workspace. And with this new area became an opportunity to update the rest of the visual style to be on par. Everything from the sign up flow to the users profile page was updated to reflect the new style. All with the aim for visual consistency, and reducing friction in use.

### Updating the brand
The Smart Sparrow website was in need of a major overhaul. Not only to reflect our new branding work, but also to make the site mobile response. We renewed our brand message, including all visuals to present ourselves as student first. Since launch time on site is up, and conversion rate is up by 5%.

This allowed teachers to have a much better overview of their students and lessons, all in one area.
All marketing material. Site design, business cards, banner
Now we had one area for users to manage their students. We also needed to make them aware of how that affected their license usage. The quota wheel became the perfect UI shorthand to highlight the limits of a license.

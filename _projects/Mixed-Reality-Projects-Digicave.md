Digicave was a creative studio, specialising in mixed and augmented reality projects. Our proprietary 46 camera rig could capture and model an object using photometry. Our leading edge was that we put capture quality first, with unbeatable industry knowledge. The level of detail was so good, we could capture pores on a models face, and individual strands of hair. I was hired as their first designer, responsible for all design work that came out of the studio. As my first true startup experience, I loved it. I owe a lot of what I've learnt about my technical skills and how to manage design from my time there. A studio ahead of it's time - RIP.

Our work for TEDx focussed on putting users in control of the frame. Throughout the day the attendees could find custom TEDxHoP posters to scan with our app. Each frame had a unique AR scene for them to find their perfect angle, and share online with the world.

HTC needed a way to create a deeper product understanding of the HTC One for it's upcoming release. Our solution was an AR avatar, highlighting core value propositions of the device. Through visual storytelling, users could scan displays to have a virtual walkthrough.

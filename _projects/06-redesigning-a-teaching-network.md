The BEST Network is a platform for academics to collaborate on biomedical education. The first of it's kind, it now has 2,000 educators and hundreds of courses online in just 2 years. I was the design lead on the latest version of the network. Including the design of it's brand, marketing and summit launch. Since this launch, there's been a huge 28% increase in lessons being deployed to students through the network.

## The starting point
The previous design focussed on having all courses in one large list, which served as a catalogue for all courses available on the network. While this was great to promote how much content was on there, there was no easy way to shortcut to something without knowing what it was called. This also had the side effect of no real grouping of similar content, or any real community around it.

## Putting discoverability first

We needed to make it's core content more discoverable, and refocus the network around this new community focus. For it to be a functioning network, we needed users in similar disciplines to find and collaborate with each other, and to know what was happening in their field. To find content relevant to them faster, so they could teach with it quicker. This renewed focus on the communities within the network drove all design decisions.

## Creating a home for disciplines

As a first land, we wanted to make it clear which discipline groups we had on the network, and also the size and activity in each – after all this is what makes it exciting for users that want to become a member. Initially we tried icons to differentiate between disciplines, but they were too abstract to be meaningful or easily recognisable, so went with colour blocks to create visual shortcuts. We were then able to bring in lesson thumbnails to the new card design without them competing visually with the rest of the network.

## Encouraging participation

Something unclear in previous designs of the site was how you could get your own lessons onto the network. We wanted to dedicate some time to making this process simpler and easily understood, so we could grow the number of lessons on the network, benefitting all the members.

## Smoothening the adoption flow

The teaching of content is the ultimate goal, as this tied to revenue for the company (increase in membership signups) and is where the users get the most value from the network. After iterating with the engineering team to bypass some technical constraints, the new flow took less than a few minutes to find a lesson you wanted to teach, and have a link ready to teach with it to your class – a big improvement on previous designs.

## Updating the brand to match

New brochures, banners and site updates had to be designed specifically for the event, and update the brand assets to match. Using the theme of the loops created a nice visual across all three designs, and was a system we could incorporate into further emails, and upcoming campaigns to attendees and network members.

## Weaving it through the event

To carry through the new communities, discipline name tags were given to all attendees. Grouping by discipline drove home the value of the new community driven site design. Bold colour blocks also had the nice side effect of being an easy ice breaker for attendees. You can read more about the details of the event [here.](https://www.best.edu.au/best-summit-2015/)

This was one of the biggest events the company had ever put on, and required a lot of collaboration between design, marketing, and the learning designers who created the lessons for the network launch. It was a huge team effort, and whilst completely exhausting to meet the deadline, was a lot of fun on the day.

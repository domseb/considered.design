Our take on the TEDx theme of democracy, was democratising content through our medium of sculptural photography â€“ putting users in control of the frame. Throughout the day the attendees could find specially created TEDxHoP posters to scan with our app. Each frame that could be scanned had a small red indicator in a corner, and behind each one was a unique AR scene for them to find their perfect angle, and share online with the world.

Smart Sparrow is a product for Learning Designers to create online courseware. Allowing anyone to create personalised lessons that can adapt to individual student needs. I joined after their Series B to give a dedicated focus on the user experience across their products. For the past 2 years Iâ€™ve been the design lead across all product, brand and marketing efforts.

My initial focus was to reduce the steep learning curve of the product. While the promise of the product was exciting, there was too much friction to ever actually get there. We wanted to create something to get the users invested in the promise as early as possible.
<!--
Realising the need for better prep before creating courseware was a big turning point in our work. What started as a 24 step tool tip marathon around the product, we cut right back to the fundamentals. We focussed on small, bite size interactive lessons to show the power of the tool. Each for different parts of the product, contextual to the stages of the users workflow. Giving them the best understanding and preparation to create something meaningful in the tool. -->

The epicentre of the product are the rules that dictate what personalises to the student. These rules define actions that will happen when a student fulfills the rule's conditions. For example, a rule to show feedback when the student selects a certain answer. This is the area the user spends the most time, so we needed improve the flow and simplify the creation process. We found patterns in how users created rules, and wanted to create better groupings for speed. Better groupings also helped new users understand which situations to use rules in. To best benefit the lessons they were trying to build.

At this stage of the product, there was no error validation on these rules. If I created a rule about a specific input, and then deleted the input, we weren't giving any feedback to the user. We collected every current use case for reported errors, and prioritised the critical ones. Errors that make users feel like they can't recover from, and churn.

After addressing the easier wins in the product, we started rethinking our approach. We didn't want to just iterate on what we had, and end up with something derivative. We wanted to try and rethink the product, see what we would do if we started over. I lead 2 product offiste retreats, to prototype and test new out new ideas with users. We tested with 50 users over 5 weeks to iterate fast and learn. We moved from a product that was focussed on screens and rules, to students and what they needed. Putting them at the centre of design decisions, kept focus on always benefitting users.

The full section of this work is under NDA, please get in touch to understand more.

design offsite - major student breakthrough. student profile. NDA

A prompt on one of the screens asked the user to write a piece of feedback for a virtual student

The users feedback then being shown to that virtual student to teach the main concept of the tool

I've lead two offsite design retreats to address the problems with the product. In both we've addressed core conceptual debt, and created new ways

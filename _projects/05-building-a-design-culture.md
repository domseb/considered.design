Smart Sparrow is the first really complex product I've worked on, and at around 50 people also the largest startup I've worked for, both of which come with lots of interesting design challenges. Anyone who's tried to build a design culture knows how challenging it is, and having something as small as personas take hold in the team feels huge. While we are a long way from a design culture we're all happy with - I feel like we recently reached a milestone in our approach, and worth sharing.

## Creating a design process

When I started we were designing only up to a week in front of engineering, and it was a lot of bandaids. Over time we've created a process that creates better outcomes, and has created a much more comfortable lead time between us and engineering – which is important if you want to design meaningful changes to a product.

## Improving consistency and understanding

Before, we also no working design file, repository of design assets, or way for engineers to easily understand what to use and when. After working out where design was the biggest bottleneck, and eliminating some of the most frequent requests on us, our UI designer then created this site to contain everything we were creating, accessible to everyone. The biggest impact has been having a working design library, which enables new low level features to be built without needing the same design investment as before.

## Refining the product

The core creation tool has had various sections redesigned over my time at Smart Sparrow, which is covered in more detail in [this project.](/projects/01-designing-learner-centered-tools/) There have been significant changes in how we now approach design projects. From the practical way to make our icons being pixel perfect, to re-using patterns rather than everything being custom designed. Even to how we design for accessibility and low contrast – all of these refinements to the product have made our design system more robust.

## Leading design offsites

I'm a big believer in that when designing a complex product, and want to take a significant departure from where the current product and thinking around it is – you need to leave the office and go somewhere new to think. I've been lucky to have been able to lead on these a few times now, and it's allowed us to reimagine our approach and goals in the best possible way.

## Building a design culture

One of the best improvements you can make to a design team is improving the language it uses to talk about design. It helps with better feedback, better brainstorming, and better communication with non-designers across the company. One of the more recent changes, was having a weekly work in progress meeting across the design departments (product, learning designers and marketing) to discuss what they've created this week. It's helped with people introducing their work better, and in giving more constructive feedback, to help grow each others ideas.

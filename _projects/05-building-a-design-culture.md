I know what you're thinking — another designer showing process with post its? Is this guy serious? Possibly the only way I could out cliché this is maybe, a flowchart on glass? Perhaps I could cup my hands and place a plant in them to represent the new idea? I hear you. However anyone who's tried to build a design culture knows how challenging it is, and having things like personas take hold in the team is a huge win. It's taken me 2 years to refocus the conversation around design thinking. And while we are a long way from a creative culture we're all happy with - I feel like we recently reached a milestone in our approach.

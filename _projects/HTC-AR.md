My role on this project as Lead UX designer was to design how we could engage the employees off the retail floor, through one of Digicaveâ€™s AR avatars for maximum impact, as well as creating the minimal UI for the app. Focussing on three of the key HTC One features, I highlighted their impact through a highly visual story for the user to follow and engage with, to create a deeper product understanding.

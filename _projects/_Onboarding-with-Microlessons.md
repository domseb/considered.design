When I was hired by Smart Sparrow as their Senior UX Designer, my intended focus was to help reduce the steep learning curve of the product, and to create an onboarding process that could expedite the journey for new users to become power users.

### About Smart Sparrow
Smart Sparrow is a learning design platform that enables anyone to create rich, interactive and adaptive elearning courseware.
After [raising $10m in 2014](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/smart-sparrow-lands-in-the-us-and-raises-10-million-1888384.htm) and expanding to San Francisco, they’ve worked with over 500 institutions globally, and won numerous awards. Their latest project is next-generation science courseware, funded by a [grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.afr.com/news/policy/education/bill-gates-backs-aussie-startup-smart-sparrow-20141005-jludb), to help educate 250,000 community college across the United States.

### Rebuilding the relationship
When I started this was a 24 step tool tip marathon around the product, which although descriptive, wasn’t educating the users on anything but the shallowest understanding of the tool. It was replaced with our first attempt at a new onboarding tour, which ended up becomming a long click through, outlining all the concepts, without any real enjoyment for the user.

Inspired by [Primer](https://www.yourprimer.com/), we wanted to break it down into a series of micro lessons, that we can spread across the areas of the product, to make the information you were being given, contextual to which part of the product you were in.

### Getting the users to invest in the story
The onboarding tour we had created had the right points to say but the wrong way of saying them. The promise of the product boils down to software that can recreate all the benefits of one to one learning, online at scale. This is an exciting promise for educators, and we wanted to get the users invested in that story as soon as possible. More importantly it went against our values of what makes the best learning experiences - visually rich, interactive, and personalised. Before we had dealt with it in abstract terms, but now we’d changed it to ask the user questions, and it would use their answers to demonstrate how the product worked.

### Creating smooth handovers & maintaining presence
After trialling automated onboarding emails, we realised the issue wasn’t in just getting users back into the product – there was no continuation from those emails to when they landed in the product to tell them what to do next. We’re now using a service that allows us send the same automated emails, and then greet them with personalised messaged once they log back in, in different areas of the product, and most importantly, at different stages of the process the users is at.


### Next steps
I’ve always treated onboarding as a deliverable on a checklist, but after working on a product for an extended period of time, it’s clear to say it’s a very involved, very important process for success, and it’s never something that’s finished.

As part of a business requirement to how per user licensing was handled, I lead the <span redesign of Smart Sparrow’s core product flows to make cohort management, and understanding how it affected their license, a streamlined process.

### About Smart Sparrow
Smart Sparrow is a learning design platform that enables anyone to create rich, interactive and adaptive elearning courseware. After raising $10m in 2014 and expanding to San Francisco, they’ve worked with over 500 institutions globally, and won numerous awards. Their latest project is next-generation science courseware, funded by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to help educate 250,000 community college across the United States.

### Consolidating processes
In broad strokes, Smart Sparrow has two main products – one to create courseware (the Author), and one to manage the courseware and distribute it to students (the Workspace). The Workspace for a long time has been centred around individual lessons, meaning all global actions you can make to a lesson (enrolling students to take the lesson, sharing the lesson, adding collaborators etc) were all done on that lessons page. This meant that to teach two different lessons to the same group of students, you’d have to enrol them in one lesson, and repeat the process for the same lesson, a tedious process for all users.

We needed to design a place to centralise all these actions in one place, giving teachers complete control of their students and content they are teaching them. After months of requirements gathering, user stories, brainstorming, prototyping and testing, we finally had a design that we were happy with, and could move into engineering.

### Making the right information visible
Another problem we were designing to solve, was liberating all the important information the user needed out of modals. Anything we felt was core information necessary to manage the class, was stripped out of a modal, and given a new home in the Classes tab. This allowed teachers to have a much better overview of their students, and lesson status, all in one area.

### Reducing modal steps
For some actions, we still had to have them behind modals, but we wanted to streamline the design of these as well. Through a small feature audit, we were able to consolidate options the user needed to take, made their descriptions much more concise and remove some options entirely. What would previously take up to 10 steps before to enrol students and deploy lessons to them, now only took 3.

### Highlighting license restrictions
Now we had one area for users to manage their students, we also needed to make them aware of how that affected their license usage. Although for new users this would easier to elaborate on, for existing users we needed a clear, visual UI marker to help indicate the higher boundaries of their license, to make sure they didn’t go over their quota. After a series of experiments, we created the quota wheel below, using animation and colour to highlight the limits of the license.

### Still to come
There’s still some features and changes related to Classes that haven’t quite made it to production, and some more still we want to change in the coming months relating to student analytics. You can learn more about Smart Sparrow by [visiting their website](https://www.smartsparrow.com/).

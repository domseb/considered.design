When I was hired by Smart Sparrow as their Senior UX Designer, my intended focus was to help reduce the steep learning curve of the product, and to create an onboarding process that could expedite the journey for new users to become power users. 

#### ABOUT SMART SPARROW
Smart Sparrow is a learning design platform that enables anyone to create rich, interactive and adaptive elearning courseware. 
After [raising $10m in 2014](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/smart-sparrow-lands-in-the-us-and-raises-10-million-1888384.htm) and expanding to San Francisco, they’ve worked with over 500 institutions globally, and won numerous awards. Their latest project is next-generation science courseware, funded by a [grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.afr.com/news/policy/education/bill-gates-backs-aussie-startup-smart-sparrow-20141005-jludb), to help educate 250,000 community college across the United States.

#### REBUILDING THE RELATIONSHIP
Although the best onboarding processes are well documented, tried and tested examples from designers around the world, I’ve found none that go beyond the basics, or deal with advanced, enterprise level software. This is normally because with this type of software, there is normally a sales associate or training paired with the license, and we wanted to try and make this a no-touch sales process. When I started this was a 24 step tool tip marathon around the product, which although descriptive, wasn’t educating the users on anything but the shallowest understanding of the tool.

Inspired by [Primer](https://www.yourprimer.com/), we broke it down into a series of micro lessons, that we can spread across the areas of the product, to make the information you were being given, contextual to which part of the product you were in. 

#### GETTING USERS TO INVEST IN THE STORY
The onboarding tour we had created had the right points to say but the wrong way of saying them. The promise of the product boils down to software that can recreate all the benefits of one to one learning, online at scale. This is an exciting promise for educators, and we wanted to get the users invested in that story as soon as possible. More importantly it went against our values of what makes the best learning experiences - visually rich, interactive, and personalised. Before we had dealt with it in abstract terms, but now we’d changed it to ask the user questions, and it would use their answers to demonstrate how the product worked.

#### MAINTAINING PRESENCE
I’ve always treated onboarding as an item on a checklist. Like building a presence for Smart Sparrow online, it’s never something that’s finished, or ends.

Before writing this I had 412 items in my Pocket list. A tiny handful of them I’d actually read. A few just misplaced bookmarks. The remaining? Hours and hours worth of articles. 412 reading obligations, growing every week.

I signed up for Pocket late in 2012, soon after it changed from Read it Later. Before Pulse was ruined by LinkedIn, and iPad newsreaders delivered RSS feeds in quaint little faux newspapers - Pocket was my first. It was simple to use, had feature parity with everything else, but honestly I just loved the cleverness of the name. With my new iPad accompanying me on an hour commute each way to work, it was also the first app I installed that was actually useful. “When you find something you want to view later, put it in Pocket.” The promise of being a real utility for me to consume more information, in a meaningful way.

The problem is it’s never had a real chance to keep it’s promise. A problem that’s not with Pocket at all really. It’s with me, and my terrible reading habits. It’s with my secret delusion that just by saving an article to read later, that by intention alone it’s going to grant me a bit of the knowledge of what’s inside. With every click I was a that much closer to being well informed about my industry, or who the latest whoever is.

This problem is the same problem I’ve had with countless bookmarking or save it later services. They optimise themselves around adding links quickly, and at tagging and storing them well. None of them have ever focussed on the retrieval of these links - no triggers to get me to go back into the service. So I frequently end up at this point of digital saturation, where I have an overwhelming amount of these reading obligations nagging away - so I decided to close my account.

In fear that one of these articles has value I might miss (a symptom of pathological hoarding), an article so valuable I might regret not reading it forever, I had one final glance through my list. It might be me subconscious wanting the same old content because I'm never actually reading the original, but there was a undeniable trend in content.

> I'd like to see a change in the tide of what our apps help facilitate. What I really want here is something that helps me have a better reading habit.

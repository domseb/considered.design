This week Apple released [the winners of the Shot on iPhone challenge](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/02/apple-highlights-best-photos-shot-on-iphone-around-the-world/), selected by panel of judges including [Arem Duplessis](https://twitter.com/aremduplessis) (director of photography for Apple's Marketing team), [Luísa Dörr](https://www.instagram.com/luisadorr/?hl=en) (award winning TIME portrait photographer) and [Pete Souza](https://www.instagram.com/petesouza/?hl=en) (Obama era White House photographer). Not to detract from the winner's work, they will all look at home on the Apple billboards they get placed on for as their prize, but throughout the Shot on iPhone campaign I've always wondered just how much editing has gone into these images? The colours surely can't have been that saturated, or the detail naturally that sharp. Having now looked through them all though, I guess the point is it doesn't actually matter. Proven in the 2 year ad campaign and resulting challenge, the quality now possible with just a phone camera is outstanding.

While a few of the winners leveraged breathtaking scenery, others played with perspective. A few were framed in a reflections on the ground, reminding me of the "Puddle" woodcut by M.C. Escher. Sufficiently inspired, I decided to take a stroll through my own camera roll. A handful of well organised travel folders aside, it's just a steady stream of moments I would otherwise never remember. Colourful manhole covers in Japan. A close up picture of an ornate ferry token in Whitianga, New Zealand. A good helping of the daily mundane too, like the first loaf of bread I made at home. The glass of cold brew at a local cafe, set by a copper spoon that just looked pleasing in the morning light.

While none of mine would place in a competition, using my iPhone 7plus has definitely improved them. The main camera is 12 megapixels, nearly 10 times the megapixel-ness of my first camera phone (the Samsung D500 for the curious). The clown like size of the 7plus was made bearable by the camera, and portrait mode sealed the deal. It promised the final thing you really miss from a DSLR—pictures with depth of field—and after the disappointing iPhone 6 (god I miss you, easy and enjoyable to hold iPhone 5), the camera was really the only reason to upgrade the phone. Arguably the premise behind the entire Shot on iPhone campaign, it pretty much still is the only reason.

After browsing through my library though, I had to think—what exactly am I planning on doing with all these bloody pictures? There's literally thousands. All ignored, just a steadily growing iCloud account of my life. Going back to sort them all would be madness, but without any real curation it's just noise mixed with nostalgia. Although Apple Photos tries, and things like Timehop hopes, the services I'm pouring all this footage of my life into still haven't found a way to package it up well. There's no way to resurface these moments in a way we can or want to engage with.

This is all maybe particularly top of mind because last month, House Sebastian grew by one, and as a first time parent I'm acutely aware of these pictures having a new status in the library. Like all photos, these are a blind attempt to slow time, These are shared memories, ones she'll want to see at some point when she's older. Having them only accessible through my phone feels wrong in a way, and iPhone award winners or not, having something to externally relive and mount them in makes them feel renewed with purpose.

Maybe soon companies will figure out a way to make our giant collection of photos and videos we take digitally meaningful again. Maybe the next thing startups will "disrupt" with be funerals, and they'll turn our giant iCloud libraries into a warming slideshows for our families. Until then, I guess this little photo book will have to do.

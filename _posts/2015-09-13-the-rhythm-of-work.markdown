Starting Questions
link to the wired piece about needing to keep in the curious

1. Why am I writing it?
- because I’m at a point of recognition in my work life that deserves to be articulated and shared
- to practice my writing skills
- to actually finish something

2. Why do I think it’s relevant?
- this feeling is common amongst designers, if not everyone, regardless of their skill level or background
- there’s so much talk about tools at the moment, and little on the craft we are actually trying to build meaningfully 

3. What is the mood/feeling of the post?
- dawning realisation that I’ve been doing it wrong and how easy it is to fall into. and by doing it right, I’ll be more satisfied as a designer and be better at my craft as well

4. What are the meaningful points, the takeaways?
- I used to think side projects were for people unhappy at work, but they are actually for keeping sane creatively. 
- don’t yield to the demanding pressure of work, it’ll burn you out, and if you want to be working like that in 20/30 years then good luck to you, but for the rest of us
- a promise to work on the craft, and to stop mindlessly discussing the tools. take the time. 

Whats the insight here?
A lot of us are in bad, or abusive relationships with our work, and we should stop excusing it. 


**Introduction**
1. outline common problem
2. introduce purpose of the post
3. start with moment of transparency 


**The Rhythm of Work**

I was strolling through a forgotten side street in East London, the afternoon sun warming the cobbled brickwork and graffiti, when I stumbled upon the most exotic little bookstore. Layers and layers of zesty magazines and creative titles I’d never heard of, it was like a exotic print store. The owner clearly enamoured with his work, so in love with print, it almost felt like he had created this business just so he could be around this many printed titles and call it his job. His nose deep in his latest read, the sense of belonging he had to his craft was palpable. I thought to myself, how have I found myself in such an abusive relationship with my own work?

The best breaks are made of moments on serendipity like this, and have always acted as a natural point of reflection in where I’m at. 


**Worthy Mentions**
1. 32 hour week Treehouse
2. Designing the middle


The Rhythm of Work

- - -

1. Starting out, drunk in love with the possibility of it all. 
2. Then residual tensions, the parts that need to be done for the design to happen, pull you away from the parts of the work that you love
3. points of friction taking you away from getting their fast
4. get in the way of the fun part of design. The challenge of it
5. slowly. layers harden over the core reason you started
6. residual tensions pull you away from the passion. meetings. feedback cycles. file management. handovers. reporting up
7. energised by others making meaningful steps. like a bad relationship, after a few years you have to question, why am I still doing this?
8. You’ve lost touch with experimentation. No dates anymore. It’s predictable and you’re not your best anymore. You’re not trying. Buy in all time low. 
9. Always felt they are out movie stars of design. Gleaming smiles in interviews, effortlessly pushing their products and companies ahead with meaningful design decisions.

**Worthy Mentions**
1. Dylan Baskind. Sickeningly good at multiple things. Too many things. 
2. David Muhr. Can’t remember why. 
3. Uncle Joe
4. Maria Popova
5. Swiss Miss
6. Julie Zhou - silicon valley up and down

1. Freelancing, never worked in an established design company. This tension of having to establish processes, it’s exhausting. Why do we continue with it?
2. Because when it works, it’s exhilarating. When everything aligns, it feels like magic. 
3. The uphill challenge. 
4. How can I get to increasing the frequency of this. Making the climb more enjoyable. 

**worthy mention**
1. Seth Godin - not about finding a better holiday, but making a life you don’t need to take a holiday from

1. Recently we’ve sacrificed experimentation at the beginning of projects, and ease in handover for just getting through the work. The next project will be better, we’ll improve that next time. 
2. Talk on this is a crowded room, so I won’t have anything new to add to it. But I will say there is a lot to be done. Get shit done
3. Design sprints. And a relentless push on productivity is damaging to long term happiness in design. 
4. it’s hard to attach lasting meaning to transient moments. Improve the surroundings or get out and walk. 

**worthy mention**

Dom goodrum - permission to daydream

1. so much chatter. I don’t care about Slack vs hip chat. or sketch vs photoshop. and I especially don’t care about commentary on flat design. I care about how considered design solutions are and how you’re finding meaning in your work. how you unceremoniously are pushing product changes, with no one knowing the internal points of friction that you overcame to get there.
2. working forward. value capture at work. How to enjoy the journey.
3. what is the key components to be carried forward by the characters?
		4. relationship with work
		5. finding meaning in your work
		6. hobby vs work
		7. considered design and finding meaning
8. “falling in love with the new”
9. do what you love vs love what you do

**worthy mentions**

Ben chestnut - love what you do

Finding meaning in your work vs creating meaning. 

**worthy mention**

seth godin - why do we stay in abusive design relationships

1. WHat’s the CTA here? what do I want the reader to do? reach out on twitter? to expand on this themselves? how do they solve it?
2. I’m lucky in that the designers seat at the table was pretty much waiting for me when I started my career. 
3. cat vs invisible. I want them to consider something. invitation to discuss
4. letstalk@considered.design, discuss@considered.design

considered.design/thoughts
considered.design/work
considered.design/info

**aren’t we due something new**?

setting the stage
1. intense working hours
2. nostalgic trip back to logon
3. train of thought getting to all the side projects
4. time to write, reading list impossibly long from pocket to fit into two weeks I was away
5. why am I not doing these things at the moment?
6. first read this idea of not working on going on better holidays, but work on making your life less in need of a holiday
7. tending the spark
8. time for dust to settle
9. vacuum of no work — reading 
10. finding the joy of creating again
11. noticing the oscillating focus of trying to specialise in and out of an area

got a list of side projects, some really stinkers, but one has some promise. and I’m happy to say I’m going to be pursuing it. That is all

this week I’ve had breakfast at home, with coffee and fresh juice, reading something from my kindle, and left at a reasonable time - and the walls didn’t fall down. 

today as I write this I’ve tried yoga, and for the first time I’ve actually completed a draft of this ready to send to friends for review.

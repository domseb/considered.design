As part of a business requirement to how per user licensing was handled, Smart Sparrow had to restructure how their core product flows worked to change it from being content focussed, to management focussed.

#### ABOUT SMART SPARROW
Smart Sparrow is a learning design platform that enables anyone to create rich, interactive and adaptive elearning courseware. After raising $10m in 2014 and expanding to San Francisco, they’ve worked with over 500 institutions globally, and won numerous awards. Their latest project is next-generation science courseware, funded by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to help educate 250,000 community college across the United States.

#### CONSOLIDATING LOOSE ENDS
In broad strokes, Smart Sparrow has two main products – one to create courseware (the Author), and one to manage the courseware and distribute it to students (the Workspace). The Workspace for a long time has been centred around individual lessons, meaning all global actions you can make to a lesson (enrolling students to take the lesson, sharing the lesson, adding collaborators etc) were all done on that lessons page. This meant that to teach two different lessons to the same group of students, you’d have to enrol them in one lesson, and repeat the process for the same lesson, which was fast becoming frustrating for users. 

To coincide with the licensing change affecting student count, we needed to design a place to centralise all these actions in the same place, and make it easier to understand how the licensing restriction affected their quota. 

#### CROSS-CONTINENT TAXONOMY
After creating our wireframes, and prototyping our flows, we still were going with a name internally we weren’t sure would stick. After various user interviews, testing our assumptions with the UI and if key elements were discoverable, 

#### CONCISE INTERFACE COPY
I despise repetition, in almost any capacity. 

#### STILL TO COME
Our changes have made the adoption cycle shorter,

The Handmaiden is a visual feast. Everything feels immaculately placed, and the film has a tactility to it that makes for very enjoyable viewing. I’ve never known how to describe this well, but it feels like the sounds that frame the dialogue are heightened in some way; the clipped sound of heels on floorboards, the Count picking the lock in the staircase, the sound of the catch closing on heavy wooden doors – even the sounds of fabric as they undress, all have such presence in the story. Being an eastern film, with so much unfamiliar in the environment, clothing and rituals – this tactility adds to the feeling of exploration in the scenes.

Considering the films length, the pace is kept surprisingly well, and only in the first act did it feel a little slow to me. Although on reflection, I realised this is likely intentional for stage setting and to make viewers vulnerable for the first twist – Sook-hee being committed instead of the Lady.


## Central Theme

This is pitched as a love story, but the more interesting theme that emerged for me was around the dual-identity – and how the film plays with suppressing each characters real one, depending on the context of who they are with. Each of these identities has a desperation to escape who they are (intention), which is entangled in desire (obstacle). While their intentions vary, some of their desires are pure and real (like between the Lady and Sook-hee), whilst some ugly and orchestrated (the Uncle and his grooming of the Lady to read for his friends).

Acting as the backbone of the suppressed identity theme is the Uncle. While suppressing his own Korean identity is the obvious thread to pull here, it’s his obsession with alternating English and Japanese identities that help drive the contrast of dual-identity throughout the film. The opening scenes setup this theme with such a deft touch:

1 — Sook-hee, whilst arriving in the car, removes her ornate (and by association expensive) hairpin to wrap in the paper from her food parcel. This is the first (of many) times a part of her identity is concealed.

2 — Quickly after she arrives, when after she has been introduced to the buildings unique dual-identity, Sasaki gives Sook-hee a new Japanese name. Notice this is the first time Sasaki has faced her, as if by giving her this new name she is acknowledging her. Sook-hee is also hidden from view, another nice visual metaphor about hidden identity.

3 — As they enter the other wing, they have to put their shoes back on. This is subtle, but it’s another cue about dual-identity, and suppressing one in different contexts. I don’t know if I’m mad, but the sound the clogs make on the floorboards as they put them on, is carried through in a similar sound (again, professional creator of sounds, what is that instrument called?) the unsettling background music as they enter the next room


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491263177463_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+09.46.05.png)


4 — Hard to capture here, but this is the first time we taken to a hand held camera. After focussing on the awe of Sook-hee’s face as she sees this area, the camera whirls around the room to mimic. It’s begging us to look as well, to take in these details, because what follows is important.


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491262501553_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+09.30.29.png)


5 — Few things to note here. I can’t help but think using the term “lovers” is foreshadowing the Uncle. What’s great about this shot is the music has these unsettling flute (?) sounds that plays as Sook-hee meets eyes with the child in the painting – another example of foreshadowing. She is filmed form above, putting us in the perspective from the painting, subtly introducing her not only as a character in the film, but also the relationship between these two characters. Worth noting, they are reflecting each others poses, and dress. Which in the context of the strange European surrounding, actually unites them.

6 — As she walks past, the lighting on the canvas changes, and a dual-identity is revealed. It’s subtle, almost subtle enough I thought I was imagining it, but it’s there. Combined with the flutes (?), this is acting as a big signal of the characters relationship going forward. Connection, but not necessarily trust.

7 — Sook-hee has taken a step back just as this line is said. For me, this is where the theme of dual-identity (and suppression of identity) is cemented. Two light sources (the Japanese lantern Sasaki is holding, covered by the European chandelier), in a room with two different styles (Japanese portraits within a European setting), with Sasaki saying this line above Sook-hee.


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491264538907_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+10.08.44.png)


8 — The camera cuts on the line (scene cutting is something I think was very well done in this film) which introduces us to another colour theme I’ll unpack below. The purpose of this cut I think is to focus us on a stare – and not this one, but the one that immediately follows. This is also only the second time Sasaki has faced Sook-hee, but this time we are put in the place of her, adding emphasis. After this the character turns her back on Sook-hee, which again I think is for emphasis on who is still  starting at her in the next frame.


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491264049849_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+10.00.38.png)


9 — Here we see Sook-hee in frame, slightly amused, with the background just out of focus. This is significant, because she also didn’t look at this image on the way up, only the one of the Lady as a child. When she walks away the painting comes into focus, another foreshadowing of something that becomes a common thread throughout the film - the mother’s suicide.

This beginning sequence unfolds in a very well thought out order, designed to create intrigue, and mixed messages for the viewer. The placement of the paintings, and the camera switching between first person and observer, also unlocks another asset to propel the theme forward – the non-linear storytelling structure.


Non-linear structure

I love (love, love) non-linear film structures, and this film uses it to great effect. I think as a viewer I love it because of the little reveals that happen throughout the film, that normally lead you to think you know what’s going on. It builds trust in knowing the outcome, normally acting as distraction from the main plot twist coming up (the bigger the trust the more emphasis this twist has). But it’s like a story puzzle, so find it very satisfying putting it all together. From a creators point of view, I think it’s the appreciation of how hard it must be to pull it off well.

For this film, this is introduced in the very first scene when Sook-hee is saying goodbye to people we don’t know yet. It at first looks like a sad goodbye, but we realise the only adult crying is crying out of jealousy. Although it’s only 7 minutes in, a lot has happened between this opening scene, and the scene that reveals how the plot came to be. Through this we are introduced to the Count and Sook-hees true identities, and what their intentions are (escape from these true identities through material gain). We are also introduced to a some early recurring themes, such as the Sake being fed to babies, and lines like “What does a crook know about love”. These lines are repeated throughout the film, by different characters to other characters - propelling the theme forward.

Colour grading and style

Stylistically, the film sways between this dark and moody green, emphasised by low lighting, and the lush brightly lit greens of the garden outside.


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491266325164_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+10.35.38.png)
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491266325328_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+10.37.17.png)


For me the vibrancy of the green outside, and the conversations and scenes that happen within it (namely the hanging, the reveal of the Counts true plot to the Lady, and secret conversations he has with both of them), symbolise the strength of the desire to escape. This is used to great effect when the Count thinks Sook-hee is interfering with the plan, and they have a heated discussion in the only barren area of the gardens - or metaphorically, a dying desire to escape.


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491267010239_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+10.50.02.png)


Colour further plays a role in suppression and reveal of identity throughout the film, although I’d have to watch it again to pick up more from it. Something that stuck out were scenes like these:


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491266410339_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+10.38.12.png)


There is a natural contrast in colour from the aqua coloured furniture and blue surroundings and the amber lamps in the background. They cast no light onto the subjects themselves, so aside from looking nice, I think these are again to highlight the contrast in scene - foreground and background, facade identity and true.

Other parts I noticed on first viewing were the Lady wears pink the first time her and Sook-hee are in bed together. They wear red and purple when they are in Japan (lots of symbolism for those colours in Japan). She wears blood red when she demonstrates with the mannequin, and the same colour when she is first punished with the bells as a child in the same room. Again, I think on second viewing with this in mind would reveal more.


Camera movement

Throughout the film the camera movement reveals a lot to the viewer. Lots of tracking shots at the beginning when we are in the maid’s perspective for Act I, following her through her instructions and duties. Around 22mins in we get put into the first intimate exchange between Sook-hee and the Lady when she grinds her sharp tooth down in the bath - the camera emphasising this by putting us into their perspectives. At around 27mins in the lens is changed to look like it’s from our point of view, to refocus on the undressing of the Lady - again driving home the connection between them. Early on (around 42mins in) the Lady and Sook-hee are in bed together for the first time, and the camera zooms in so slowly to them that it’s barely noticeable, but really builds the tension in the scene. The camera constantly switches between participant and observer, which again I think is intentional for pushing the  theme of dual-identity - especially as who’s is real and who’s is false is exaggerated through other characters points of view later in the film.


Favourite shots

Two shots I’d love to unpack more with a bit more time, is the first and last scene involving what will be the stage for much of the construct of identity in the film – the annex library. When we are first taken to the library, Sook-hee opens the door, and the camera dollys past her, picking up pace to reveal the Uncle (and Master) for the first time, panning down to reveal the room. It’s the only time we have this pace of camera movement, and I haven’t got a huge amount to say about the scene right now, except that I really liked it. It works really well at establishing what kind of person the Uncle is, and his relationship will be with Sook-hee.

![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491267909330_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+11.05.00.png)


A good connection between this scene and the next one I want to talk about, is this closing shot of the Uncle’s stained tongue. I’m not sure what it is he’s putting in his mouth, but I think it’s a device to highlight how black his tongue is. We see later in the film it’s whilst he’s writing he uses his tongue to lubricate the pen, which has caused the stain – it’s inked. Which brings me to the next shot.

The second shot worth noting, (although I think there are much more interesting scenes) is the ending where the Uncle is reading out the Lady’s letter of betrayal. This is one of the most memorable cuts made in the film, between the Uncle reading the letter face on, with music (with her voice over, a lovely touch again to the dual-identity), to this:


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D3A77BFC7073016887906694BC792924121894FC0FE0B101198F948C24186447_1491267162819_Screen+Shot+2017-04-04+at+10.52.35.png)


As he sets the letter down, the music fades out. And all we can hear is the sound of the octopus writhing around in confinement. It’s a demonstration of power (the octopus is enormous) and the sound it makes is really unnerving. It’s a bit of a stretch, but I like the parallel between the octopus and the shot with the ink. Octopus uses ink to disappear, to hide itself. The Uncle has been using it to create a new self.

The fact it’s in the basement, hidden from view, and enclosed into what looks like a box too small for it - is only the surface level of it’s symbolism in the film. It’s real value here I think, is highlighting the suppressed sexual nature of the Uncle, as a way to contrast against the sexual liberation (and dropping of facade identities) in the final scene with Sook-hee and the Lady after this one. The octopus is also the same size as it’s illustrated counterpart, shown earlier in the film, as part of the reading sessions. I thought it was a brilliant bookend to the struggle between the Count and the Uncle.

Discussions around toolsets
At family christmas MIL quoted my numerology outlook for 2016 and said “you must be weary of making plans, and only plans, and losing sight of the vision”. Comparisons around prototyping tools. Just new ways of doing the same things. Sketch. Jia. Worrying about workflow.

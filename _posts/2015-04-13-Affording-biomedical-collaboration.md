Over the past 6 months, I lead the design of a major update to the BEST Network's flagship product, [Slice](https://www.best.edu.au/slice/), to better integrate it into our academic's workflow and teaching. It involved rethinking parts of our taxonomy, core flows, and designing new UI to encourage collaboration amongst students and academics. 


#### SOME BACKGROUND
Slice is a tool that lets academics and institutions upload scanned medical images, to annotate them as an interactive virtual slides for their peers and students to learn from. What this means for academics, is liberating the glass slides they otherwise would be storing on shelves in the lab, to share and build upon with a global network, online. What this means for students, is an online replacement to multiheader microscopes in labs, allowing them interact with the content in way not previously thought possible.


#### CORRECTING THE FIRST STEP
I first saw Slice early into 2014, and instantly saw the value it could provide as a tool for learning. Borrowing from Google Maps, it used a familiar mental model in how you interact with a virtual slide, had a seeming abundance of slides and contributors to learn from, and the quality of the scans were remarkable. Microscopic scans at 40x zoom look more like art than anything else. 

When you first landed in the tool however, there was a common friction point in getting users to the next stage, the first hurdle in any UX project - guiding them on what they should do next. These users had an account, they had a clear goal to annotate their virtual slide, but had no idea where to action this, or why they couldn’t move forward.

#### STILL TO COME
There’s still some features and changes related to Classes that haven’t quite made it to production, and some more still we want to change in the coming months relating to student analytics. You can learn more about Smart Sparrow by [visiting their website](https://www.smartsparrow.com/).

    <h3>Hi there. My name's Dominic</h3>
    <h1 class="fade-in-up">I'm a design lead focussed on creating long term value in products & teams.</h1>
    <!-- <p>I care about creating clarity in my work, especially in projects where needs are fuzzy and unknown, through a thoughtful and considered design approach. I think this is the only way design can be truly accessible, and deliver people genuine value.</p> -->
    <p>Originally from London, I'm currently based in sunny Sydney, working as the Deisgn Lead for Qwilr. Read more about me <a href="/profile">here</a>, or check out my portfolio <a href="/work">here.</a></p>
